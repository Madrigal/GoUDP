# TODO
- Get confirmation when sending a message
- Figure out how to change server at runtime (Don't know if this is a real requirement, it just stands that the server needs to be chosen)
- Handle user output with XML (should be fairly simple)
- Send files (not necessarily P2P)
- Send offline messages
- Block users

# For later
- Synch clocks
- Get weather from web service
- Connect with FB
