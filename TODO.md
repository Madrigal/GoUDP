# TODO
- <del>Handle user input with XML (should be fairly simple)</del>
- <del>Add flag to start either as a server or as a client (temporary)</del>

- Use channels to handle message sending/validation (partially complete, need time validation)
- <del>Get confirmation when sending a message</del>
- <del>Send offline messages</del>
- <del>Block users</del>
- <del> Add message type for files </del>

- <del> Collect user clocks on n time </del>
- <del> Update using Berkeley algorithm </del>
- Connect with <del>FB</del> Twitter :) (https://github.com/carbocation/twitter)
- Figure out how to change server at runtime
- Create an abstraction layer for communicating with other client

# For later
- Create path on demand for user (probably just ask him)

# Stretch goals
- Separate server and client code
- Add a proper logger with a debug switch
- If starts with "/" and not a valid command don't do a broadcast
